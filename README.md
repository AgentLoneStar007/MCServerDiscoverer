# MCServerDiscoverer
This is an extremely simple script that searches every possible IPv4 address
in existence to see if it has a valid Minecraft server linked to it on port
25565. This port can easily be swapped for something else, like 25595.

Use the script to your liking, but DO NOT distribute it as your own.
